# Trees
Creating a Binary Tree and a Binary Search Tree implementation

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a BinaryTree class
- Create a BinarySearch Tree class


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->

## Tests
- Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
- Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
- Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
- Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
